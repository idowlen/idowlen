I'm originally from Ohio, but have lived all over the U.S.
I also have a Bachelor of Arts concentrated in 3D animation.
I will use my knowledge of of code and design to bridge the gap between engineering and design and to create life changing applications.
I love the beach, anime, and traveling, and believe life is what you make it. Make the best of it.
